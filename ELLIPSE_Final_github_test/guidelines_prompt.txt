KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

Phrase: Multiple word units

Grammar: The rules by which words change their forms, including the use of word classes and grammatical morphology in English. Word classes include prepositions, pronouns, nouns, verbs, etc. Grammatical morphology includes third person, plural, possessive, etc.

Syntax: Structuring sentences according to syntactic rules related to coordinating clauses, developing syntactic phrases (noun, verb, preposition phrases), phrasal and clausal dependency, and transformations such as passives, relative clauses, and negations.

Cohesive device: Cohesive devices are used as links between two or more items (e.g., words, phrases, clauses) in a text to enhance text cohesion. These include the use of conjunctions (and, but, if, on the other hand), transitions (first, next, finally, for example), repetition of words, phrases, and ideas across sentences and paragraphs, and the use of anaphor (pronouns replacing nouns).

Simple, complex, and compound sentences:
- Simple: Independent clause
- Complex: Independent and dependent clauses
- Compound: Two of more independent clauses

Chunks: Multiple words that combine to have a single meaning. Often memorized without knowing what the individual words mean (e.g., "How are you" for "Hello")

Lexical bundles: Multiple word units that are common in English but are not idiomatic ("There is"). More common than collocations.

Collocations: Two or more words that are often used together (e.g., save time, go to bed, fast food).

Idioms: multi-word unit where meaning not deducible from those of the individual words (kick the bucket, rain cats and dogs).
